Description: Intel Connection Manager daemon
 The Linux Connection Manager project provides a daemon for managing
 Internet connections within embedded devices running the Linux
 operating system. The Connection Manager is designed to be slim and to
 use as few resources as possible, so it can be easily integrated in
 other Moblin-based embedded systems. It is fully modular system that
 can be extended through plug-ins, to support all kinds of wired or
 wireless technologies. Also, configuration methods like DHCP and
 domain name resolving are implemented using plug-ins. The plug-in
 approach allows for easy adaption and modification for various use cases.
 .
 This package contains the connman daemon and its plugins.
